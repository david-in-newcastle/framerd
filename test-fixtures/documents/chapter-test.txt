I strode straight down the sweeping tree-lined curve of Georgian terraced that lies to one side of the little city park. The sun was intense and I was trying not squint, just walk tall and straight into it.

I felt I that I would like see Om. The area were we sat was quiet. And don't have any sense of what was about to happen.

She said hello and smiled. Its a nice day, she remarked. I could have used a double Vodka too. The silence (The Silence!).

I've let Om know your here. They all new my name. And your here, with us.
