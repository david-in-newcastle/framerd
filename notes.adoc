== Notes on FramerD prose review tool

=== Diagnostic severity
We seem to be constrained by the VSCode diagnostics model to having four severity types: Error, Warning, Information and Hint. And icons to go with that, and a colour of squiggle too.

That's not terrible, by any means. However it seems to ignore Category or Type of review totally. And there are types: Spelling, Grammar, PoV, Tense, Style, Voice, Praise, Remark.
